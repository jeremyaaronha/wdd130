    <h2>Jeremy Herrera</h2>
    <h2>Memi</h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm Jeremy, most of people call me Memi. I'm 22 years old, I'm from Santiago, Chile.I love to play voleyball and listen to music. Until recently I was working as a telecommunications technician, but now I'm just studying. </p>
    <p>I decided to study here because I like to pace myself and I think it's a more efficient way of learning. I am relatively new to programming but I am very interested in being able to improve myself and continue learning more. Also I'm a member of the church since I was a child. </p>
    <p> My native language is spanish, so forgive me if I make any mistakes. This is a photo of me from when I served my mission in Argentina Mendoza.</p>
